This section may more accurately be titled "Perceiving space: Other", as senses other than touch, like smell, will be discussed here. The sense of "self" is separated and discussed over [here](PerceivingSpaceSelf.md). This page focuses on external "feeling" senses. 

[Sight](perceivingSpaceVision.md) and [Sound](PerceivingSpaceAcoustics.md) may be the primary tools we have to perceive space, but they are also the most processed and assembled from a variety of cues and knowledge. They are the most mediated, illusory, and thus manipulatable. Much harder to manipulate is our sense of touch and our sense of selves. 

While this presents a challenge to designers, it's also why experiences that effectively consider these senses can be among the most powerful and effective.

Fist, lets discuss what to do without the senses we don't have control over. Despite the lack of [consumer-available olfactory instigators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISmell), a designer must be aware of what kinds of things are not in their control, as it can help them learn where to focus their efforts. One simple approach is to use [postmodern signifiers](PostmodernSignifiers.md).

## Feeling The Environment
It's a real challenge to be in a space without having some direct haptic feeling of the space. Usually, through our feet.
