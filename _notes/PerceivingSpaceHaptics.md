This section may more accurately be titled "Perceiving space: Other", as other senses, like smell, will be discussed here.

[Sight](perceivingSpaceVision.md) and [Sound](PerceivingSpaceAcoustics.md) may be the primary tools we have to perceive space, but they are also the most mediated, illusory, and manipulatable. Much harder to manipulate is our sense of touch and our sense of selves. That's why experiences that effectively consider these senses can be among the most powerful and effective.

Fist, lets discuss the haptics we don't tend to have much control over. Despite the lack of [consumer-available olfactory instigators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISmell), a designer must be aware of what kinds of things are not in their control, as it can help them learn where to put other efforts.

For example, consider an environment that, in real life, would carry a strong smell: a kitchen, a meat locker, a sewer. The design of such places requires greater care and thought, precisely because we are currently unable to use the smells to signal the player of their environment. We must make up for this lack in other ways! 

Visual wisps and wiffs to represent smell are an obvious example, but lets think further: 

In media, sewers often contain a highly unrealistic and borderline magical green fog. The fog - thick, floating, and so uncannily-colored - carries the idea that one would be able to *feel* the smell of this place.

Also consider what an actual apartment kitchen may look like: a cabinet, a counter, a stovetop, a sink. Now think of an image of a kitchen as informed by visual media tells us: pots hanging from the wall, a magnetic bar holding knives bold and visibly silhouetted on the wall, some stains, a surprising amount of counter real-estate full of pans, blenders, mocha-pots, and more. Does nobody put things away? The designer of whatever space you may be imagining has done a lot of extra work on the visual imagery of a kitchen. Kitchens contain a lot of unique objects and shapes! But magnetic knife holders and hanging pots are not as popular a kitchen design as video game levels would have you believe.

Consider environments that would normally present itself through the various elements discussed on this page, such as smell. Consider what kind of work can be done to make up for this through other elements.
