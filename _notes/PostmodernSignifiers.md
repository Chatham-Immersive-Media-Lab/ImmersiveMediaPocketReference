VR Devices are currently very limited in their haptic output. They also have basically no ability to affect temperature, air condition, or smell.

As VR designers, this limits us to creating spaces that have no smell, have no sense of air quality, and whose floors or surfaces are barely a factor. Or does it?

I believe designers should pull themselves away from the draw of "realism" and consider other approaches to create spaces that more effectively evoke mood and tell stories.

Specifically, I recommend a postmodern approach where VR designers draw from the signifiers of other storytelling mediums.

### Tackling a Lack of Input Through Other Means

Consider an environment that, in real life, would carry a strong smell: a kitchen, a meat locker, a sewer. The design of such places requires greater care and thought, precisely because we are currently unable to use the smells to signal the player of their environment. We must make up for this lack in other ways. 

> I'm just using smell as an easy example here. Consider walking along the sand of a beach. In VR, we can't make the ground feel like sand. So how do we A) Get this specific idea across (probably footstep sound design) and what other elements can we bring in to help sell "beach" (we could include animated waves, seagulls, a distant pier).

We can go further. TV, Graphic Novels, Illustration, and ... basically all other storytelling mediums except for scratch-n-sniff stickers don't have smell, and they still manage to communicate it. It's possible to borrow the visual language these mediums have developed.

In media, sewers often contain a highly unrealistic and borderline magical green fog. The fog - thick, floating, and so uncannily-colored - carries the idea that one would be able to *feel* the smell of this place.

To use this visual language, one must first give up on the notion of realism as an appropriate end-goal of VR experiences. One must first accept that realism is just a tool that one can use towards achieving the goals of an experience. 

Realism is a tool that should be applied when it is appropriate - and not applied when it is unhelpful.

Also consider what an actual apartment kitchen may look like: a cabinet, a counter, a range, a sink. Now think of an image of a kitchen as informed by representations in visual media: pots hanging from the wall, a magnetic bar holding knives visibly silhouetted on the wall, some stains, a patterned drying rag, a surprising amount of counter real-estate full of pans, blenders, mocha-pots, and more. Does nobody put things away? The designer of whatever space you may be imagining has done a lot of extra work on the visual imagery of a kitchen. They have filled it with signifiers that represent "kitchen". Kitchens contain a lot of unique objects and shapes! But magnetic knife holders and hanging pots are not as popular a kitchen element as video game levels would have you believe.

Consider environments that would normally present themselves with the various elements discussed on this page, such as smell. Consider what kind of work can be done to make up for this through other elements. What is the equivalent to "magical green sewer fog" that can help you signify and identify locations that lack signifiers we have access to? 

What is the "realism" version of these signifiers? What is the "TV" version? The "Movie" verison? The "Graphic Novel" version? What about
