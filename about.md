This site is a work-in-progress document for collecting knowledge about VR.

## Project Goals
1. A glossary of terms for immersive media technology.
2. Collect the notes, guides, and resources assembled for students of the Chatham Immersive Media Program, and make them available publicly.
3. Serve as a convenient gateway to existing information & resources.

## Who did this
This currently just a side project by Hunter Dyar, me. I teach Immersive Media at Chatham University and was writing a glossary for my intro course when I thought "lets just put this out there". It's... a work in progress.

## How the site works
This site is currently hosted through GitHub Pages. Students - or anyone - will be to use pull requests through git to contribute.
